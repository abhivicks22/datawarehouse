# Bank Data Warehouse Project

## Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive data warehouse solution for a banking institution. The data warehouse consolidates information from multiple source systems to provide a unified view of the bank's operations, customers, products, and transactions. It is designed to support business intelligence, reporting, and analytics to drive strategic decision-making.

## Repository Structure

- **Documentation**
  - `business_requirements.md` - Business requirements and objectives
  - `data_sources.md` - Information about source systems and data formats
  - `conceptual_model.md` - High-level entity relationship diagrams
  - `logical_model.md` - Detailed data model with attributes and relationships
  - `data_warehouse_architecture.md` - Technical architecture and component design

- **Implementation**
  - `physical_model.sql` - DDL scripts for creating the data warehouse schema
  - `etl_processes.py` - ETL implementation for data extraction, transformation, and loading
  - `data_quality.py` - Data quality checks and monitoring framework

## Architectural Components

### 1. Data Sources Layer

The data warehouse integrates data from multiple operational systems:

- **Core Banking System** (SQL Server) - Transactions, accounts, balances
- **CRM System** (Cloud API) - Customer information, interactions, satisfaction
- **HR System** (MySQL) - Employee data, branch staffing
- **Loan Processing System** (Oracle) - Loan applications, approvals, performance
- **Branch Management System** (CSV) - Branch information, facilities
- **Product Catalog** (PostgreSQL) - Product details, rates, terms
- **Marketing Campaign System** (API) - Campaign performance, targeting
- **ATM Transaction System** (Logs) - ATM usage, availability
- **External Data** - Economic indicators, demographics, competitor data

### 2. ETL Processes

The ETL process handles the extraction, transformation, and loading of data from source systems to the data warehouse:

- **Extraction**: Connects to source systems through database connections or API calls
- **Transformation**: Cleanses data, applies business rules, handles data type conversions
- **Loading**: Loads data into staging tables and then into the dimensional model

Key features of the ETL implementation:
- Configurable source connections
- Data validation and error handling
- Incremental loading capabilities
- Logging and monitoring
- Exception handling and notifications

### 3. Data Warehouse Structure

The data warehouse follows a dimensional model with star schema design:

- **Core Entities**: Branch, Customer, Employee, Transaction, Product, Loan
- **Dimension Tables**: Region, CustomerSegment, TransactionType, ProductType, Channel, Date
- **Fact Tables**: TransactionFact, LoanFact, CustomerFact

Performance features:
- Table partitioning by date
- Appropriate indexing strategy
- Materialized views for common aggregations

### 4. Data Quality Framework

A robust data quality framework ensures the reliability and accuracy of the data:

- **Completeness Checks**: Ensures required fields have values
- **Accuracy Checks**: Validates data against business rules
- **Consistency Checks**: Verifies referential integrity between tables
- **Validity Checks**: Confirms data types and formats
- **Timeliness Checks**: Ensures data is up-to-date

The framework generates detailed quality reports and logs issues for investigation.

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Platform

The data warehouse is implemented in PostgreSQL with the following features:
- Partitioning for large tables
- Custom extensions for advanced functionality
- Schema separation for organizational clarity
- Automated maintenance tasks

### ETL Implementation

The ETL processes are implemented in Python with these key components:
- Database connection management
- Data extraction from diverse sources
- Data transformation logic
- Loading with error handling
- Scheduling and orchestration

### Data Quality Monitoring

The data quality framework provides:
- Configurable quality rules
- Automated checks and validations
- Quality metrics and reporting
- Alerting for quality issues

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL 12 or higher
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Python packages: pandas, psycopg2, requests, faker

### Setup Instructions

1. **Database Setup**
   ```sql
   -- Create the database
   CREATE DATABASE bank_dw;
   
   -- Connect to the database and run the DDL script
   psql -d bank_dw -f physical_model.sql
   ```

2. **Python Environment Setup**
   ```bash
   # Install required packages
   pip install pandas psycopg2-binary requests faker numpy
   ```

3. **Configuration**
   - Update database connection parameters in the Python scripts
   - Configure data source connections as needed

4. **Running the ETL Process**
   ```bash
   python etl_processes.py
   ```

5. **Running Data Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   python data_quality.py
   ```

## Project Evolution

This project follows a systematic development approach:

1. **Business Requirements Analysis**: Understanding the bank's reporting and analytics needs
2. **Data Source Identification**: Mapping available data sources to requirements
3. **Conceptual Modeling**: High-level entity relationship design
4. **Logical Modeling**: Detailed attribute and relationship design
5. **Physical Implementation**: Database schema creation and optimization
6. **ETL Development**: Data integration implementation
7. **Data Quality Framework**: Ensuring data reliability
8. **Reporting & Analytics**: Enabling business insights

## Future Enhancements

Planned future enhancements include:
- Real-time data integration capabilities
- Advanced analytics and ML model integration
- Self-service BI portal development
- Mobile dashboard access
- Predictive analytics for customer behavior

## Best Practices Implemented

- **Data Governance**: Clear ownership and lineage tracking
- **Security**: Role-based access control and data protection
- **Performance**: Optimized for query performance and scalability
- **Maintainability**: Well-documented and modular code
- **Extensibility**: Designed for future expansion
