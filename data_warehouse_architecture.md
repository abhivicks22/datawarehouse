# Bank Data Warehouse - Architecture Design

## System Overview

The bank data warehouse architecture follows a modern, scalable design that supports both batch and real-time data processing. The system is built on PostgreSQL with the following key components:

1. Data Sources Layer
2. ETL Layer
3. Data Warehouse Layer
4. Data Mart Layer
5. Presentation Layer

## Architecture Components

### 1. Data Sources Layer

#### Internal Systems
- Core Banking System (SQL Server)
- CRM System (Cloud API)
- HR System (MySQL)
- Loan Processing System (Oracle)
- Branch Management System (CSV Files)
- Product Catalog (PostgreSQL)
- Marketing Campaign System (API)
- ATM Transaction System (Log Files)

#### External Data Sources
- Economic Indicators (API)
- Competitor Data (CSV Files)
- Demographic Data (CSV Files)

### 2. ETL Layer

#### Extract Process
- **Batch Extraction:**
  - Daily: Transaction data, ATM logs
  - Weekly: Customer data, Product data
  - Monthly: Branch performance data
  - Quarterly: External market data

- **Real-time Extraction:**
  - Transaction monitoring
  - Customer interactions
  - ATM transactions

#### Transform Process
- Data cleaning and validation
- Business rule application
- Data type conversion
- Aggregation and calculation
- Data quality checks

#### Load Process
- Initial load for historical data
- Incremental load for new data
- Real-time updates for critical metrics

### 3. Data Warehouse Layer

#### Core Schema
- Core entities (Branch, Customer, Employee, etc.)
- Dimension tables
- Fact tables
- Time dimension

#### Data Quality
- Data validation rules
- Error logging
- Data quality metrics
- Audit trails

### 4. Data Mart Layer

#### Business Unit Marts
- Retail Banking Mart
- Loan Services Mart
- Customer Analytics Mart
- Branch Performance Mart

#### Aggregated Views
- Daily summaries
- Monthly reports
- Quarterly analytics

### 5. Presentation Layer

#### Reporting Tools
- Executive dashboards
- Operational reports
- Analytical reports
- Ad-hoc query interface

## Data Flow

### Batch Processing Flow
1. Source systems generate data files/feeds
2. ETL jobs extract data from sources
3. Data is transformed and validated
4. Transformed data is loaded into staging area
5. Data is loaded into warehouse tables
6. Materialized views are refreshed
7. Reports are generated

### Real-time Processing Flow
1. Source systems generate events
2. Event stream is captured
3. Real-time transformations are applied
4. Data is loaded into real-time tables
5. Dashboards are updated

## Performance Optimization

### Partitioning Strategy
- Transaction tables: Monthly partitioning
- Fact tables: Monthly partitioning
- Historical data: Yearly archiving

### Indexing Strategy
- Primary keys on all tables
- Foreign key indexes
- Composite indexes for common queries
- Bitmap indexes for low-cardinality columns

### Materialized Views
- Monthly branch performance
- Customer segment analysis
- Product performance metrics
- Loan portfolio summary

## Security

### Access Control
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Schema-level permissions
- Table-level permissions
- Row-level security

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- Audit logging
- Data masking

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### System Monitoring
- Database performance metrics
- ETL job status
- Data quality metrics
- System resource usage

### Maintenance Tasks
- Regular index maintenance
- Statistics updates
- Partition management
- Backup and recovery
- Archive management

## ETL Process Details

### Daily ETL Jobs
```sql
-- Example: Daily Transaction Load
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION etl_daily_transactions()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Extract transactions from source
    INSERT INTO staging.transactions
    SELECT * FROM source.transactions
    WHERE transaction_date = CURRENT_DATE;

    -- Transform and validate
    INSERT INTO fact.transaction_fact
    SELECT 
        t.transaction_id,
        d.date_id,
        t.branch_id,
        t.customer_id,
        t.product_id,
        t.employee_id,
        t.channel_id,
        t.transaction_type_id,
        t.amount,
        t.status
    FROM staging.transactions t
    JOIN dimension.date_dim d ON t.transaction_date = d.date
    WHERE t.status = 'COMPLETED';

    -- Update materialized views
    PERFORM refresh_materialized_views();
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Weekly ETL Jobs
```sql
-- Example: Weekly Customer Update
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION etl_weekly_customers()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Update customer dimensions
    UPDATE core.customer c
    SET 
        satisfaction_score = s.new_score,
        last_interaction_date = s.last_interaction,
        last_updated = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    FROM staging.customer_updates s
    WHERE c.customer_id = s.customer_id;

    -- Update customer facts
    INSERT INTO fact.customer_fact
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        d.date_id,
        c.customer_segment_id,
        b.region_id,
        SUM(t.amount) as total_balance,
        COUNT(DISTINCT t.product_id) as number_of_products,
        c.satisfaction_score,
        c.nps_score
    FROM core.customer c
    JOIN core.branch b ON c.primary_branch_id = b.branch_id
    JOIN fact.transaction_fact t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
    JOIN dimension.date_dim d ON t.date_id = d.date_id
    WHERE d.date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, d.date_id, c.customer_segment_id, b.region_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

## Backup and Recovery

### Backup Strategy
- Full database backup: Weekly
- Incremental backup: Daily
- Transaction log backup: Every 15 minutes
- Point-in-time recovery capability

### Recovery Procedures
1. Identify the recovery point
2. Restore the full backup
3. Apply incremental backups
4. Apply transaction logs
5. Verify data integrity

## Disaster Recovery

### High Availability
- Primary and secondary servers
- Automatic failover
- Data replication
- Load balancing

### Business Continuity
- Recovery time objective (RTO): 4 hours
- Recovery point objective (RPO): 15 minutes
- Regular disaster recovery testing
- Documented recovery procedures
